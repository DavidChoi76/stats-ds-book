```

```{figure} ./assets/pA_and_pB.png
:name: cousins_and

A visual representation of $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ [^footnote1].
```

And

```{figure} ./assets/pAandB.png
:name: cousins_and

A visual representation of $P(A \cap B)$ [^footnote1].
```

And

```{figure} ./assets/conditional.png
:name: cousins_conditional

A visual representation of $P(A \mid B)$ [^footnote1].
```
