# Attribution 

These notebooks and the underlying `prml` library are from the wonderful repository: [https://github.com/ctgk/PRML](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML)

The repository provides python implementation of the algorithms described in Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"

[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher Bishop)](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/)
Our primary reference for probabilistic methods, including bayesian regression, latent variable models, and the EM algorithm. It's highly recommended, but unfortunately not free online.
